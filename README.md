Pyordle is a terminal-based wordle clone. Unlike the original worldle, you can play it offline!

## Features

- **Random word generation:** Generates completely random five-letter words. None of the answers are hard-coded.
- **No duplicate guesses:** Doesn't allow you to incorrectly guess a word more than once. 
- **CLI:** Pyordle has a very visually appealing CLI.
